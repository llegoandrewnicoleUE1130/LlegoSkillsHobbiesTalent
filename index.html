        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that my primary skill that I apply to my everyday life would be my ability to quickly parse information and break it down to its important parts. <sup>1</sup>This has helped me a number of times during coding and other related projects. <sup>2</sup>To look at the code and be able to follow where it goes from event to event is something that I have honed to help with understanding what I am working on even if it is not my workprovided they have given me context on what it is supposed to do.<sup>3</sup>This skill has also helped me become an adaptable individual.<sup>4</sup>Adaptability comes naturally to me.<sup>5</sup>When placed in a new environment or presented with a new task, if given enough context and tools I can make things work.<sup>6</sup>This does not mean what I'll create would be the most optimal solution but I am reasonably sure that it will work.<sup>7</sup>Making things work on the fly has helped me perform even during high stress scenarios.<sup>8</sup>Alongside this skill is that I have also developed a skill in being a good back-up to people.<sup>9</sup>Most of the traits I have listed before are also applicable to being able to provide support to the people doing the heavy lifting in a project.<sup>11</sup>What I excel at when providing support is that I can execute most tasks given to me on time and with a degree of accuracy to the other person's visions.<sup>12</sup>This does not mean I have no input on the project.<sup>13</sup>On the contrary, I talk to them to understand what the intent of their project is and give suggestions on what could be done to further enhance the project.<sup>14</sup>I shall do as they say and finfish the work allotted to me<sup>15</sup>If I do have extra time I’ll try to create what I think is improvements on the side to check if my work is an actual improvement<sup>16</sup>I try to have a productive conversation when it comes to important work.<sup>17</sup>The skill to break down information, adaptability, and supportiveness are three skills I use.<sup>18</sup>The Three work in tandem and synergize with each other when I work on projects.<sup>19</sup>These skills are not only for work though.<sup>20</sup>It also apply to My Hobbies and Interest.<sup>21</sup>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<hr size="5%" color="1b3652">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I possess a moderate skill set in several programming languages, including Java, C#, Python, and HTML, with a particular preference for Java due to its versatility and efficiency.<sup>1</sup> My experience in Java has allowed me to work on a variety of projects, enhancing my understanding of object-oriented programming, while my knowledge of C# and Python has broadened my capabilities in both web and application development.<sup>2</sup> These languages have exposed me to different paradigms and methodologies, helping me become more adaptable and resourceful when tackling complex programming challenges.<sup>3</sup> I find that being able to switch between languages gives me a broader toolkit for problem-solving, and I enjoy the process of learning new languages to expand my skill set.<sup>4</sup> In addition to my experience in backend development, I have a good grasp of HTML, which I use to create well-structured and visually appealing web pages.<sup>5</sup> I am also familiar with CSS, and wish to continually work on improving my skills in front-end development, as I recognize the importance of user experience and responsive design in modern web applications.<sup>6</sup> My goal is to create websites that are not only functional but also intuitive and visually engaging.<sup>7</sup> As I continue to delve deeper into JavaScript and front-end frameworks like React and Angular, I am excited to develop dynamic, interactive websites.<sup>8</sup> Beyond programming, I have a passion for creative expression, which I believe enhances my problem-solving abilities.<sup>9</sup> I’ve been learning the basics of playing the ukulele, and I find it a relaxing way to unwind while exploring music.<sup>10</sup> Playing an instrument has taught me patience and discipline, as it requires consistent practice and an understanding of rhythm and melody.<sup>11</sup> My interest in music also influences my creative projects, as I often find inspiration in the harmony between technical and artistic expression.<sup>12</sup> On the artistic side, I have developed moderate pencil sketching skills, and I continue to refine my technique through practice.<sup>13</sup> I’ve explored different styles, such as realism and abstraction, and I enjoy the challenge of capturing intricate details and emotions through sketches.<sup>14</sup> Although I’m still learning, my passion for sketching drives me to experiment with new techniques and improve my precision.<sup>15</sup> Drawing is a meditative process for me, offering a chance to slow down and focus on the subtleties of form and light.<sup>16</sup> My diverse skill set spans both technical and creative fields, which gives me the ability to approach problems from different perspectives.<sup>17</sup> This interdisciplinary approach helps me stay open-minded and flexible in finding solutions, whether in programming, design, or personal creative projects.<sup>18</sup> I am always eager to enhance my knowledge in each of these areas, as I believe in continuous learning and personal growth.<sup>19</sup> Whether it's improving my coding skills, advancing my musical abilities, or perfecting my sketching, I am committed to achieving a high level of proficiency in all that I do.<sup>20</sup></p>


<h2>Interest</h2>
<hr size="5%" color="1b3652">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a deep appreciation for capturing the beauty of nature through photography, particularly flowers and landscapes from the places I have visited.<sup>1</sup> It allows me to preserve the essence of a moment and the natural world in a way that feels timeless.<sup>2</sup> Whether it’s a vibrant field of wildflowers or a serene mountain vista, I find joy in the process of framing a perfect shot.<sup>3</sup> My photographs serve as both a personal memory and a reminder of the vast beauty that surrounds us.<sup>4</sup> Alongside photography, I am fascinated by nature restoration documentaries, especially those that showcase efforts to return habitats to their pre-human condition.<sup>5</sup> These documentaries resonate with me, as they reflect the potential for healing and balance in the natural world.<sup>6</sup> Seeing ecosystems reborn through human effort and dedication is both inspiring and humbling.<sup>7</sup> Another interest of mine lies in exploring Abrahamic mythology and stories, which have shaped much of world history and culture.<sup>8</sup> I find it captivating to delve into these ancient texts and unravel their meanings, symbolism, and the lessons they offer.<sup>9</sup> Understanding the narratives and beliefs from different Abrahamic traditions gives me a broader perspective on the shared and diverging aspects of these religions.<sup>10</sup> I enjoy how these stories not only reflect the values of ancient societies but also continue to influence modern thought and ethics.<sup>11</sup> Additionally, I have a strong interest in documentaries that uncover obscure technological histories.<sup>12</sup> These films open my eyes to the inventions, innovations, and even failures that have shaped the world we live in today.<sup>13</sup> I enjoy learning about how certain technologies were developed and the fascinating stories behind their creation, which are often unknown to the public.<sup>14</sup> It’s thrilling to uncover hidden narratives of invention and progress, as it connects me to a broader historical context.<sup>15</sup> These topics—whether they be rooted in nature, mythology, or technology—stimulate my curiosity and drive me to keep learning.<sup>16</sup> By exploring these areas, I feel more connected to both the natural world and the rich tapestry of human history and innovation.<sup>17</sup> These interests keep my mind engaged and continuously push me to explore new ideas and perspectives.<sup>18</sup> I find that the more I dive into these subjects, the more I realize how much there is still to learn and discover.<sup>19</sup> Each documentary, book, or article I encounter offers a new insight, and it motivates me to dig deeper into these fascinating fields.<sup>20</sup>
